# Casali 1992: UKIRT Faint Standards

> The following table, courtesy of Dave Thompson, contains the UKIRT faint standard stars from Casali (1992 UKIRT Newsletter, 4, 33). Links on the names brings up a K' image 4 arcminutes square, with North up and East to the left.  The standard star is indicated by the tick marks.

> The K' magnitudes in the last column are interpolated. They should provide better numbers than assuming that the K magnitudes apply to data obtained with a K' filter.

> Some modifications to the table have been made, for example notations on a number of stars that are double. A more up-to-date table of FS stars can be found at the Joint Astronomy Centre Web site, at

> http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/astronomy/calib/phot_cal/fs_fundamental.html

> This latter site contains cross references, spectral types, optical photometry, etc.

> Notes: FS24 is apparently a variable star!
> FS 18, 25, and 28 are double stars.

> The values quoted above for the flux from a zero magnitude star are from Bessel & Brett (1988, PASP, 100, 1134),  scaled to zero magnitude.  Bessel & Brett quote fluxes for a 0.03 magnitude star.

If you manage to get a decent image in any K-band filter (K, Ks, K') for any of the stars on this page currently without finding charts, I would appreciate receiving a copy so I can include it here.  > Please contact me via email at <<djt@mpia-hd.mpg.de>>.

> There is also a table of interpolated K' magnitudes available.  While these numbers were not obtained through proper calibration, I have found them to be a little better than simply assuming the K-band magnitude applies to observations obtained with the K' filter.
