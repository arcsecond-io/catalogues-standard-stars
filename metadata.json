		"description": "The most commonly used calibration sources in the mid-infrared are the ones characterised by Cohen et al. in a series of papers starting in 1992: \"Spectral Irradiance Calibration in the Infrared\". A summary of these papers including a spectro-photometric catalogue of 422 stars scattered over the entire sky can be found on their Paper X (Cohen et al. 1999, AJ 117, 1864). This catalogue is included in the VISIR pipeline and the basis of the sensitivity determination for VISIR. Nevertheless these templates should be used with caution, because many of them have not been verified observationally."
