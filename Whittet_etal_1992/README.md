> Polarized Stars from Whittet et al. (1992)

> Polarization observations in the UBVRIJHK bands were made with the Hatfield polarimeter (HATPOL) by Whittet et al. 1992, ApJ, 386, 562. The results from this study, for stars reachable from UKIRT, are shown here. Only the IJHK polarizations are given here.

> Note: the K-band polarization observations were made in a non-standard K passband centred at 2.04 microns. Values appropriate to a more standard K-band filter have been calculated by Gerakines et al. (1995, ApJ, 455, L171) from power-law extrapolations of the Whittet et al. multi-colour polarisation measurements
