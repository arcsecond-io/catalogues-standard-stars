The following table, courtesy of Dave Thompson, contains the UKIRT faint standard stars from Casali (1992 UKIRT Newsletter, 4, 33). Links on the names brings up a K' image 4 arcminutes square, with North up and East to the left.  The standard star is indicated by the tick marks.

The K' magnitudes in the last column are interpolated. They should provide better numbers than assuming that the K magnitudes apply to data obtained with a K' filter.

Some modifications to the table have been made, for example notations on a number of stars that are double. A more up-to-date table of FS stars can be found at the Joint Astronomy Centre Web site, at

http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/UKIRT/astronomy/calib/phot_cal/fs_fundamental.html

This latter site contains cross references, spectral types, optical photometry, etc.

If you manage to get a decent image in any K-band filter (K, Ks, K') for any of the stars on this page currently without finding charts, I would appreciate receiving a copy so I can include it here.  Please contact me via email at <<djt@mpia-hd.mpg.de>>.

There is also a table of interpolated K' magnitudes available.  While these numbers were not obtained through proper calibration, I have found them to be a little better than simply assuming the K-band magnitude applies to observations obtained with the K' filter.
