Serkowski" Polarized Standards

Polarized standards are polarized by dichroic absorption in the interstellar (or intracloud) medium. The following "Serkowski" polarized standards are taken from "Planets, Stars & Nebulae studied with Photopolarimetry", 1974, T. Gehrels (ed.), University of Arizona Press, Tuscon, p. 170. They are based on fitting the Serkowski Interstellar Polarization Law :



The maximum polarization, Pmax, occurs at the wavelength lmax.
