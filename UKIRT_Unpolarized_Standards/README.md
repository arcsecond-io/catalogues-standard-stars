Unpolarized Standard Stars

 The stars in this table are taken from "Planets, Stars & Nebulae studied with Photopolarimetry", 1974, T. Gehrels (ed.), University of Arizona Press, Tuscon, pp. 168-169. Most unpolarized stars have large proper motions. If the stars in this list are not appropriate then it is possible to look at other catalogues (e.g. Bright Star catalogue) for other stars with large proper motions. NOTE: Many of these sources are too bright for use with UFTI.
